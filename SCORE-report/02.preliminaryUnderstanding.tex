\section{Background and Process}
\label{background}
\subsection{Project Scope}
\label{scope}
The team chose the project “AI4Agile: Developing AI-enabled tool support for user story refinement in JIRA” for our participation in the SCORE 2021competition. The project is sponsored by Dr. Hoa Khanh Dam from University of Wollongong in Australia. It stemmed from Dr. Dam's research in the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence \cite{dam1,dam2,dam3}. 

The project proposed four primary requirements \cite{proposal}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Recommend user stories that are decomposed from an epic.
	\item Recommend smaller user stories to be split from bigger user stories.
	\item Recommend subtasks derived from a user story.
	\item A visualization (e.g. a graph) of epics, user stories and tasks, and their relationships.
\end{enumerate}

In addition, the application must be integrated and easily deployed into the platform of Atlassian’s Jira software, a widely used software project management tool that provides a marketplace for add-on applications \cite{jira1}. 

\subsection{Teams and Stakeholders}
We entered the SCORE competition upon recommendation by our faculty advisor Dr. Bolong Zeng. The four team members are all senior students in the Software Engineering major at Washington State University, Everett, USA. We complete the project as part of our Software Requirement and Senior Design Capstone courses, and we name ourselves Team Katara. \footnote{As part of this year's theme of our Senior Design Capstone projects (\emph{Avatar: the Last Airbender}).} 

The team chose AI4Agile from the list since the team were most interested in working with AI. The idea of intersecting AI with Software Engineering (SE) was also intriguing, particularly for four Software Engineering major students. The project is essentially a meta-project on SE, as we would be developing an SE tool that helps with the SE process, while conducting our own SE process. 

The team enlisted the help of several faculty and industry mentors/advisors. Dr. Zeng is the faculty advisor who supervises the team's process and review our work products. As the team had no prior experience with AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP), we asked for advice from Prof. Jeremy Thompson, whose main expertise is in these fields. We also contacted the SCORE sponsor for AI4Agile Dr. Dam as soon as the team started working on the project. Dr. Dam provided us with his previous research and publications, from which AI4Agile was born, as well as sample data that he used in the past. 

As the project is a tool for software developers, we were fortunate to have Skip Baccus, a senior project manager from Microsoft, who agreed to fulfill the role as a domain expert. Throughout the project, he worked with us both as a mentor and as a stand-in for potential client. All people mentioned above rounded up the stakeholders in the project. Team member Aric Monary served as the team liaison to coordinate communications among all involved parties.

\subsection{Team Process}
We adopted an agile process for ourselves throughout the project. The members met a minimum of 2 times per week, working on both documentation and implementation tasks. The meetings led into the scrum meeting with our business mentor every Tuesday, where we debriefed the mentor on our progress on features, and solicited feedback from his perspective. In between these meetings, the team worked on their own assignments, while the faculty advisor reviewed our documentations. Figure \ref{fig:acd} shows the major activities of the team on a regular basis. Our approach emphasizes heavily on the quick feedback turn-arounds and frequent iteration loops.

The team started by studying Dr. Dam's papers, mainly \cite{dam1}, and brainstorming concepts that we considered vital to the project. We then split into doing research on various key issues, such as Jira API, NLP, and more according to individual strengths and preferences. Meanwhile, the entire team participated in regular requirement gathering sessions with the mentor to refine the initial scope of the project. Throughout the process we have obtained key understanding on the agile process itself, and how the tool can best assist within the project scope. The requirements are presented in more details in Section \ref{requirement}. As we were finalizing the necessary major features, the team simultaneously started early coding to experiment with implementation based on our earlier research. 

The development effort mainly consists of two parts: AI and UI components.  The AI components were of high priority for the majority of the project. Three members each focused on one of the three primary features, while the fourth member focused on building UI for the visualization tool. As the project came to a close, we moved the UI portion as top priority as AI development was completed. As our final milestone, we demonstrated the functional prototype of the tool to our stakeholders by conducting walkthroughs of major use cases. Fig. \ref{fig:timeline} presents the project timeline, with key work tasks and dates noted. Fig. \ref{fig:responsibility} provides an overview of responsibility assignments for functionalities of the add-on.
