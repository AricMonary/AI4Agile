\section{Introduction}
AI4Agile is an add-on application built for Jira Software Cloud \cite{jira2}, made to assist software development teams in agile environments in streamlining user story refinement. The application utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to power processes that refine user stories from epics into tasks. It offers AI-based smart suggestions of requirement work items with different levels of details: epics, user stories, and tasks. Finally, the application provides an integrated tool that allows users to visualize the explicit and implicit relationships among the requirements. Team Katara from Washington State University, Everett USA submits this report for the ICSE SCORE 2021 competition. 

The rest of the report is organized as follows. Section \ref{background} outlines preliminary background information of the app, the stakeholders, and the team's development process. Section \ref{requirement} summarizes the requirements modeling, goal-oriented acquistion and decomposition. Section \ref{design} and \ref{implementation} outline the design and implementation of the tool respectively, while the latter expanded on detailed changes made transitioning from initial design to the final implementation. Section \ref{demo} demonstrates the primary functionalities of the tool via walkthroughs of two use cases, as well as the work done for testing. Lastly, Section \ref{conclusion} reflects on the outcome of the project and explores its potential future prospects.
