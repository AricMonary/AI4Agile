\section{Introduction}
AI4Agile is an addon application built for Jira Software Cloud \cite{jira2}, made to assist software development teams in agile enviroments with user story streamlining and refinement. The application utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to power three major processes that refine user stories from epics into tasks. It offers AI-based smart suggestions of requirement work items with different levels of details: epics, user stories, and tasks. Finally, the application provides an integrated tool that allows development teams to visualize the explicit and implicit relationships among the requirement work items. Team Katara from Washington State University Everett submits this report to meet the requirement of the ICSE SCORE 2021 competition. 

The rest of the report is organized as follows. Section \ref{background} outlines preliminary background information of the app, the project stakeholders, and the team's processes working on the project. Section \ref{requirement} summarizes the decomposition of requirements into goals, and further into functional and non-functional specifications. Section \ref{design} and \ref{implementation} outline the design and implementation of the tool respectively, while the latter also expanded on detailed differences between final implementation and the initial design. Section \ref{demo} demonstrates the primary functionalities of the tool via walkthroughs of two use cases, as well as the steps done for testing. Lastly, Section 
\ref{conclusion} reflects on the outcome of the project, as well as explores future prospects of the project.
